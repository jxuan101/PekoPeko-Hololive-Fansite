PekoPeko is a Hololive Fansite built using React.js. PekoPeko is also my first attempt at using the React framework to create a website. There are plenty of improvements and features to add but there are no current plans to finish production of the website.

Implemented features include:
* Twitter embed for Holostars, Hololive ID Gen 1 and Hololive JP Gen 0-4
